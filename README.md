###Docs
* Any operations for receiving data in GraphQL are called queries and stored in queries.js
* Similar as queries, operation of adding, deleting and modifying data is called mutations and stored in mutations.js. Each operation will correspond to a specific field: UserCreate, UserDelete, UserEdit.

* GraphQL allows us to define a query that provides a common interface between the client and the server for data fetching and manipulations
